# 7-kyu-Ones-and-Zeros
Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.
<br><br>
Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.
<br><br>
Examples:
<br><br>
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
<br>
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
<br>
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
<br>
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
<br>
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
<br>
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
<br>
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
<br>
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
<br><br>
However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
